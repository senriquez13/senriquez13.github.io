Practice using images and links to created webpages.

* Page layout should match the screenshots
* Links should function - one to the homepage, one to the 'fun' page
* Make the `<title>` relevant to the content of the page
* Use **info.txt** to get citation information for both images and make sure to use it!!
* **Don't forget** the `alt` attribute on your images.
